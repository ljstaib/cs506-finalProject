## Code
- Please see `exploration.ipynb` for a Juypter notebook containing all of the code that we used to obtain our visualizations and results for this project.

## How to Run
1. Download the contents of this repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.
3. In a terminal, run `jupyter notebook`.
4. In the opened window in your web browser, click on `exploration.ipynb`.
5. Here, it is recommended that each code block is ran in order. This is so no pre-processing is skipped over. Our visualizations and results can be replicated by running the code in this file.
