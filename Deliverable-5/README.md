# Final Deliverable

## Data/Data Navigation
- Please see the "data" folder for the various datasets that we used for this project
	- "1yr" and "5yr" contain ancestry census data from 2010 to 2020.
	- "ancestry_line_graph" contains line graphs and their legends of ancestry census data from 2010 to 2020.
	- "census2000" contains ancestry data from 2000.
	- "census2020" contains ancestry data from 2020.
	- "lawful2020" contains data for "PERSONS OBTAINING LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS: FISCAL YEARS 1820 TO 2020" (immigration data).
	- "world_pics" contains saved JPGs of each decade (1820-2020) containing a world map plot of immigration data. It also contains a GIF composed of these pictures.
	- "worldmap" contains GeoPandas data to create our immigration world map plot.

## Documents
- Please see the "documents" folder for:
	- A copy of our Final Project Presentation slides.
		- "FinalProjectPresentation.pdf"
	- A copy of our Final Report.

## Figures
- Please see the "figures" folder for:
	- An image of our current ancestry prediction model.
	- A short video showing decadal time-lapse world graph of people emigrating to the US by country.

## Code
- Please see `exploration.ipynb` for a Jupyter notebook containing all of the code that we used to obtain our visualizations and results for this project.
- Please see `Prediction.ipynb` for a Jupyter notebook containing all of our code for the prediction model that we created.

## How to Run
1. Download the contents of this repository (specifically this folder).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.
3. In a terminal, run `jupyter notebook`.
4. In the opened window in your web browser, click on `exploration.ipynb` or `Prediction.ipynb`.
5. Here, it is recommended that each code block is ran in order. Our visualizations and results can be replicated by running the code in these files.
